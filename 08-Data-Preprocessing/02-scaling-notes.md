# Standard Scaler
The StandardScaler works by transforming each feature in a dataset so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1â€”a process known as standardization. For each feature value $$ x $$, the StandardScaler computes the standardized score $$ z $$ as:

$$
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

where $$ \mu $$ is the mean of the feature and $$ \sigma $$ is the standard deviation.

This transformation ensures all features are on the same scale, which improves model performance and convergence speed in algorithms sensitive to feature scaling, such as KNN, SVM, or neural networks.The StandardScaler standardizes features by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature, so the resulting distribution has a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. This helps ensure that different features contribute equally to machine learning models, especially those sensitive to feature scale. For every feature value $$ x $$, the transformation is:

$$
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

where $$ \mu $$ is the feature mean and $$ \sigma $$ is the standard deviation.The standard scaler standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance for each feature across the dataset. It transforms each value using the formula $$ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} $$, where $$ \mu $$ is the mean and $$ \sigma $$ is the standard deviation, ensuring each feature has a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. This preprocessing is crucial for many machine learning models that are sensitive to the scale of features.StandardScaler standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. For each feature, values are transformed as $$ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} $$, where $$ \mu $$ is the feature mean and $$ \sigma $$ is the standard deviation, resulting in data centered at zero with a scale of one. This helps many machine learning algorithms perform better.
